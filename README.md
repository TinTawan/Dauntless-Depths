# Dauntless-Depths
A top down 2D shooter, running through dungeon rooms and defending against the onslaught of enemies while collecting coins to upgrade your player.

My 2nd 2D game created while Studying Games Design and Development at University of Greenwich.
This game was made while focusing on the use of Object Oriented techniques to help modularity and reusability of code.

Thanks for checking it out!
